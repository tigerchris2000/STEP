# STEP
## Todos  
- add functionality to rescan and restart
- have more than 9 posible probes  
-> helper functions for:  
--> str to int  
--> int to str
- clean up on unloading module
- Python script to read and graph the tempeture
## Bugs  
- tempeturesensor doesn't give the real temp
- only one probe found
